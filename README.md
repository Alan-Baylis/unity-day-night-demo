# Unity Day/Night Cycle Demo This is a demo that I am making for the RIT Game Development Club  In this demo, we will show you how to use Unity's lighting and skybox systems to create a day night cycle for games.  The project already has some Unity standard assets and things in it already, to avoid any importing during the demo.  ### Let's get started   This demo is using Unity 2017.1.1f1  Check out the Window > Lighting menu  Create a procedural skybox   Create > Material   Set the shader to Skybox > Procedural   Mess around with the colors and other properties   Set it as the current skybox Set the sun source as the directional light  Now, if you rotate your directional light on the X or Y axis, you should see how it effects the world.    Throw a light flare on the directional light if you want!  Now lets write a quick script to control the rotation of the sun! Ultimate power...  Woo super cool  Now you can add in a terrain or something, make the world your own and show us what ya got!
